<p>This is a customized Map Design that draws some familiarities with the original Pac-Man game, but is different and unique in its own regard.</p>
<p>Being a beginner at Tile-Based game development, I created the map using hierarchical tile classes, implemented by running multiple for-loops.</p>
<p>This whole process could have been sped up by creating a 2 dimensional character array that emulates the map using characters that stand for a tile.</p>
